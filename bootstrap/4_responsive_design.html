                <strong>Texas Flooding Kills Dozens; Girls Missing from Summer Camp</strong><br>
                Texas is reeling from one of the worst floods in decades, with catastrophic flash flooding killing at
                least 24 people and causing widespread destruction. Central Texas, particularly areas around the
                Guadalupe River, has been submerged after continuous heavy rains. Several towns have been cut off,
                making it difficult for rescuers to reach survivors. Among the victims are dozens of campers from Camp
                Mystic, an all-girls summer camp, who remain missing after the river rose unexpectedly. The floodwaters
                submerged the camp and surrounding areas, leaving families waiting anxiously for updates. Search and
                rescue teams have been deployed, but difficult conditions and dangerous currents have hindered
                operations. While the immediate flood threat has subsided, the full extent of the damage is still
                unclear, with thousands displaced and emergency shelters stretched to capacity. Local authorities are
                working tirelessly to provide aid and assess the damage, and experts warn that flash flooding remains a
                significant concern as rain is expected to continue for the next 24 hours. This disaster underscores the
                growing concerns about climate change and the rising frequency of extreme weather events.

                <strong>Hamas Responds Positively to Ceasefire Proposal Amid Gaza Violence</strong><br>
                The ongoing conflict in Gaza took a new turn as Hamas responded positively to a ceasefire proposal put
                forward by international mediators. The violence, which escalated in recent days, has led to heavy
                casualties on both sides. According to reports, the Israeli military has intensified operations in Gaza,
                killing at least 50 Hamas militants in targeted airstrikes. Despite this, Hamas has shown a willingness
                to engage in peace talks, citing their interest in finding a peaceful resolution. The ceasefire proposal
                aims to halt the immediate violence, but both sides remain divided over key terms. Hamas is calling for
                international guarantees, including an end to the Israeli blockade and the lifting of restrictions on
                humanitarian aid entering Gaza. The Israeli government, on the other hand, demands a commitment from
                Hamas to cease all rocket fire and terrorist activities. Tensions remain high as the ceasefire talks
                unfold, with many hoping that international pressure will help broker a lasting peace agreement.
                However, the situation remains volatile, with the possibility of further escalation as negotiations
                continue.

                <strong>Russia Becomes First to Recognize Taliban Government in Afghanistan</strong><br>
                In a surprising diplomatic move, Russia has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate
                government of Afghanistan, becoming the first country to do so. The decision marks a significant shift
                in international relations, as many nations have been hesitant to formally engage with the Taliban
                following their takeover of Kabul in 2021. Russia’s recognition comes after months of behind-the-scenes
                negotiations and marks a change in the geopolitical landscape. Moscow has already lifted its travel
                restrictions to Afghanistan, signaling a readiness to engage diplomatically. Russian officials
                emphasized the need for a stable Afghanistan to ensure regional security, particularly concerning issues
                like terrorism and drug trafficking. However, the recognition is controversial, with critics accusing
                Russia of undermining international efforts to pressure the Taliban on human rights, especially women’s
                rights. The Taliban has promised to respect the rights of women under Islamic law, but many remain
                skeptical of these assurances. The move could also influence other nations’ stance toward Afghanistan,
                as Russia is likely to push for increased recognition in the coming months. The situation remains fluid,
                with other countries still weighing the decision to recognize the Taliban government.

                <strong>Japan Panic Over “Megaquake” Manga Sparks Flight Disruptions</strong><br>
                A resurgence of panic in Japan has been sparked by a popular manga series, "The Future I Saw," which
                predicted a devastating earthquake to occur on July 5, 2025. The manga, originally published in 1999,
                has found a new audience, especially among younger generations who are worried about the possibility of
                a "megaquake." In the story, the protagonist experiences a massive earthquake that devastates Japan, and
                the recent reprint of the manga has rekindled fears of a similar disaster. While Japan is no stranger to
                earthquakes, experts have been quick to reassure the public that there is no scientific basis for
                predicting earthquakes with such precision. Despite these reassurances, anxiety has caused disruptions
                in daily life, with some flights being canceled as a precautionary measure and people opting to stay
                indoors. Seismologists have warned against such panic, stressing that earthquakes cannot be predicted
                with any certainty. They also emphasized that while Japan is prone to earthquakes, the likelihood of a
                megaquake happening on any given day is extremely low. This incident underscores the ongoing challenges
                Japan faces in managing public anxiety over natural disasters.

                <strong>Summer 2025 to Feature Three Shortest Days Due to Earth's Faster Spin</strong><br>
                In a surprising scientific discovery, astronomers have revealed that summer 2025 will experience three
                of the shortest days on record due to Earth’s increasing rotational speed. On July 9, July 22, and
                August 5, the length of a day will be reduced by up to 1.51 milliseconds, a phenomenon that scientists
                are calling "hyper-acceleration." This shift in the planet's rotation has been linked to changes in the
                Earth's core and the redistribution of mass within the planet. While these reductions in day length
                might seem minuscule, they are significant enough to be detected by precise atomic clocks. The
                shortening of days is a natural result of the Earth's fluctuating rotational speed, which is influenced
                by various factors, including gravitational interactions with the moon. While this change will have
                little impact on our daily lives, it is part of a broader pattern of changes in Earth's behavior.
                Experts have suggested that by 2029, a "negative leap second" may be added to atomic timekeeping systems
                to account for the increasing speed of the Earth's rotation.

                positional play, making him a promising addition to the team. Celtic fans are excited about the
                potential partnership between Inamura and the club’s established defenders, with hopes that he will form
                a solid backbone for the squad. The Japanese market has become an increasingly important focus for
                Celtic, who have previously had success with players from Japan. Inamura, who impressed during his time
